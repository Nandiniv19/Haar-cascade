The work starts with initializing the Haar Cascade model by taking an input image (whether it may be static or dynamic) by pre-processing the input images.
Two directories are available. Raw images can be found in the images directory. These are raw materials.
The data directory contains training-related files.
A collection of photographs used to categorise facial expressions. This repository contains a collection of face expressions that can be used to train machine learning algorithms.
Kaggle was used to collect the data. Now you may improve the accuracy of this vast dataset by training it, and the output will be the object class of the input image. The job of the training stage is to collect samples that can be labelled as positive or negative.
Anger, happiness, neutrality, and surprise are the four categories here. Haar cascade classifier is used to detect the items. This, above all, comprises the legend. csv, which associates a face expression with an image in the photos directory.
Local binary patterns (LBP) is a visual descriptor used to identify image characteristics in texture form determined by LBP.
